# VBA Challenge
## Stock Analysis Overview
Steve wanted to analyze a range of stocks for his parents. We created a file that analyzes the ticker starting and ending prices and calculates the rate of return. 
## Results

Steve's parents had originally wanted to invest in the DQ stock. As we can see from the 2017 results, the return rate was 199.45%. Based on this information alone we could assume this would be a great stock for investing.  

### 2018 Results

Unfortunately this trend does not continue into 2018. We see the return drop 62.6%. Based on this analysis it would be better to invest in ENPH that has a steady positive rate of return. 

## What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
One of the major advantages of refactoring code is not having to repeatedly type in the same data. However, this can also be a negative since you are jumping between lines to alter the values. You might lose track of why you are making the changes and what your code is communicating to the program.
